# Udacity Item Catalog Web Application

This is a README for a web application of an item catalog written for the
Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree.

---

To access the web application, go to the URI:

    54.184.75.80

This will take you to the homepage of the Item Catalog to view in a Web
browser!

To access the server via the command line there has been a user of "grader"
created and set up for use by using this command:

    ssh -i [location of "grader" ssh key] grader@54.184.75.80 -p 2200

The password for the "grader" user is "grader". The user "grader" does have
sudo capabilities, and the only way to login to the server is via SSH key.

Note that the SSH port is not default, but has been changed to port 2200.
This is the only port available for SSH login.

*It is also not possible to login to the server as root for security purposes.*
